title: Terraform ate my minecraft server - a sad postmortem
---
Incidents in the devops/infra world are always emotionally charged situations, but for me, feeling only sadness about the situation is a first.

As with most postmortems, there’s nothing “super corner case” around it. It’s not a bug in the kernel that happens once every 10 years with a full moon, it’s something that I could imagine happening, has a very logical explanation, miscalculated the odds for it happening and well, here we are.
