&lt;p>It’s been an amazing voyage. The learning curve is steep for the first 1-2 days, till you grasp the whole idea but then that’s mostly it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The language syntax is a bit weird and ugly but it really is quite simple - and I say that with 0 background in math or functional languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fusion 360 Internals: Trying to re-invent Fusion’s GUI (and failing)</title><link>https://whynot.fail/reversing/fusion-360-internals/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/reversing/fusion-360-internals/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is one of those weird ones where I try to do something batshit crazy and I end up inevitably failing. It was almost too clear that this is gonna be the path but I needed something to hyperfocus on to have some stress-free moments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how I tried to use only the engine/rendering canvas of Fusion and re-implement the whole GUI around it from scratch (toolbars, browser, history bar, etc.).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The art of cracking software</title><link>https://whynot.fail/reversing/the-art-of-cracking-software/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/reversing/the-art-of-cracking-software/</guid><description>&lt;p>As the years have gone by, it seems that cracking software is more and more synonymous to “malware”. As this world no longer knows how to operate in a manner of doing something for the common good, selfless moves that would give access to people that can’t bear the stupid “entry price” have been shadowed by moves that replace that “entry price” with remote access instead of money. It pains me and makes me sad, but at least I can share some aspect of it, as I’d rather not go to jail.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This post is written in Notion</title><link>https://whynot.fail/coding/notion-blog/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/coding/notion-blog/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve been searching for a way to write blog posts through a beautiful, mobile-friendly interface for almost two years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notion was always a very good answer but the code required to make it work was always keeping me back. But I finally did it, this blog’s content is now fully hosted in Notion&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are some UIs built specifically for git enabled static sites like &lt;a href="http://forestry.io">forestry.io&lt;/a> but all of them lack the support for custom pieces of markdown (also known as &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/">shortcodes&lt;/a> in the &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">hugo&lt;/a> world). This makes the actual blog posting experience harder, as your general view of the content is quite different to what the user will consume.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making PCBs at home: Milling the first layer (and why you need it)</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/making-pcbs-at-home-milling-the-first-layer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/making-pcbs-at-home-milling-the-first-layer/</guid><description>&lt;p>For the past 5 years I’ve been obsessed about finding a super quick way to make hobby-grade PCBs at home. The race I was looking to win was the “I don’t want to wait 3 weeks being able to do nothing after I remembered that I2C needs in-series resistors”. I want to get my board in my hands in about an hour without doing much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I found the way, but most importantly, I found the workflow. Let me show you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clear nrf52 saved BT bonds</title><link>https://whynot.fail/notes/clear-nrf52-saved-bt-bonds/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/notes/clear-nrf52-saved-bt-bonds/</guid><description>&lt;p>Often the nRF52 micros get stuck or misbehave and reach a weird state with the pairings. Often the solution is just to clear them so here’s adafruit’s code to do that and a &lt;a href="http://platform.io/">platform.io&lt;/a> ini to make it easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>platformio.ini&lt;/code>&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>The board can be any nrf52 board, it can be any generic board that uses the same chip that you actually have. For example &lt;code>particle_xenon&lt;/code> uses nRF52840, so it can be used for any 52840 board. It might though not flash the correct LEDs, so just hook up the serial port.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dry your filaments in the drawer</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/filament-drawer/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/filament-drawer/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a weekend project to keep your filaments safe &amp;amp; dry. It’s very easy to rebuild and adapt to your needs with (hopefully) available spare parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a long term abusive relationship with the 3D printing hobby, where I was brutally murdered several times as described &lt;a href="https://whynot.fail/factory/things-that-went-wrong-with-my-ender-3/">here&lt;/a>, it was finally time to find a good partner and settle down. I bought the Original Prusa MK3S. I can finally print dickbutts using plastic. The printer just works, there’s nothing more to add.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things that went wrong with my Ender 3</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/things-that-went-wrong-with-my-ender-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/things-that-went-wrong-with-my-ender-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why is it that hard to 3D print across years? Why can’t I have consistent printing experience, while not spending a kidney? I don’t get it. Why is the machine constantly failing? I’m a computer guy, I know that human errors are all over the place but how does a machine break on its own so frequently. And don’t get me wrong, it might be a budget Creality Ender 3 but it’s proven to be a good machine and its components are not majestic. This is me… sad…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rusty Arduino bindings using PlatformIO</title><link>https://whynot.fail/coding/rusty-arduino-bindings/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/coding/rusty-arduino-bindings/</guid><description>&lt;p>Oh Rust, how much I love you… Love at &lt;del>first&lt;/del> third sight, like I had with my English teacher. She was ugly but I was 10 and she was a female that stood near me for an hour and talked to me in a soothing voice. That’s what Rust is, ugly but it’s there for you with a soothing voice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other side we have C++ that the Arduino Framework is written on. Classes here and there, mixed with C, requiring a 3 day workshop to understand what’s the “standard” way of blinking a LED - hence the headache of each Arduino library taking the matters on their own hands. I hate reading C++ by the way and don’t know how to write it. That’s why I want to just forget about it and just call it from Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding more magic to the Magicforce 68</title><link>https://whynot.fail/hardware/magicforce-68-reversing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/hardware/magicforce-68-reversing/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a small journey on how I reverse engineered the &lt;a href="https://drop.com/buy/magicforce-68-key-mini-mechanical-keyboard">MagicForce 68&lt;/a> keyboard and tried to add bluetooth functionality to it. It’s a small keyboard (68 keys, 65%) and is USB-only (it’s not the smart model). It has a controller that I can’t flash with a custom firmware, so I had to hook wires on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-hardware">The Hardware&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The first step in determining what I was against, was to at least partially disassemble the keyboard.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MicroPython on Bluefruit NRF52832 with J-Link and openocd</title><link>https://whynot.fail/notes/micropython-on-nrf52832-with-openocd/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/notes/micropython-on-nrf52832-with-openocd/</guid><description>&lt;p>First of all, lets flash Adafruit’s NRF52 bootloader for easier future flashing&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My J-Link was “Broken. No longer used” - or so the JLink tools said (AKA bought from e-bay). So I had to go to &lt;a href="http://openocd.org/">openocd&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Connect the J-Link (or any SWD capable debugger supported by openocd - even an FT232 breakout will do) to the target - I have a Bluefruit by Adafruit.&lt;/p>

But mostly is my desperation in computer font. Rust why don’t you love me? I read about you, I spent nights and days. I fought the borrow checker monster for you. I learned about lifetimes.

&lt;p>I just wanna call you via a C binary. I don’t want you to fly. I just wanna love you…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chinese Factory v0.2 - Plastic À La Crème</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v02/</guid><description>&lt;p>Take a breath, sit back and think: Why the fuck not spend some money instead of endless, painful hours?

&lt;p>Welcome ladies and gentlemen on another miserable and painful part oooooof &lt;em>drumroll&lt;/em> the CHINESE FACTORY!!!

I’m not talking about the people, suicidal thoughts or racism against Chinese people, I’m talking about being able to make stuff. Quickly and effortlessly. So, instead of paying a factory and waiting for a month, I’d like to pay 10x the cost and cry myself to sleep, before I can get what I want. But it’s a one time thing :) (per machine).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
