The race I was looking to win was the “I don’t want to wait 3 weeks being able to do nothing after I remembered that I2C needs in-series resistors”. I want to get my board in my hands in about an hour without doing much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And I found the way, but most importantly, I found the workflow. Let me show you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Things that went wrong with my Ender 3</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/things-that-went-wrong-with-my-ender-3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/things-that-went-wrong-with-my-ender-3/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why is it that hard to 3D print across years? Why can’t I have consistent printing experience, while not spending a kidney? I don’t get it. Why is the machine constantly failing? I’m a computer guy, I know that human errors are all over the place but how does a machine break on its own so frequently. And don’t get me wrong, it might be a budget Creality Ender 3 but it’s proven to be a good machine and its components are not majestic. This is me… sad…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chinese Factory v0.2 - Plastic À La Crème</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v02/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v02/</guid><description>&lt;p>Take a breath, sit back and think: Why the fuck not spend some money instead of endless, painful hours? You don’t have money ok, ok, but what if you… &lt;em>WAIT&lt;/em>. Wow, a new world, 3D printing, ACTUAL 3D printed hollow cubes that I PRINTED. Oh wait, is that smoke?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Welcome ladies and gentlemen on another miserable and painful part oooooof &lt;em>drumroll&lt;/em> the CHINESE FACTORY!!! Starring: - Tears - Anxiety - A Creality Ender 3 3D Printer kit that I got from gearbest - 1 month waiting - Smokey electronics&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chinese Factory v0.1 - The-Plastic</title><link>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v01/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/factory/plastic-v01/</guid><description>&lt;p>All I ever wanted, was a tiny Chinese factory inside my house. I’m not talking about the people, suicidal thoughts or racism against Chinese people, I’m talking about being able to make stuff. Quickly and effortlessly. So, instead of paying a factory and waiting for a month, I’d like to pay 10x the cost and cry myself to sleep, before I can get what I want. But it’s a one time thing :) (per machine).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
