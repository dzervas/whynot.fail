She was ugly but I was 10 and she was a female that stood near me for an hour and talked to me in a soothing voice. That’s what Rust is, ugly but it’s there for you with a soothing voice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other side we have C++ that the Arduino Framework is written on. Classes here and there, mixed with C, requiring a 3 day workshop to understand what’s the “standard” way of blinking a LED - hence the headache of each Arduino library taking the matters on their own hands. I hate reading C++ by the way and don’t know how to write it. That’s why I want to just forget about it and just call it from Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rust, let me share your awesomeness with C</title><link>https://whynot.fail/coding/rust-c-api-pain/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/coding/rust-c-api-pain/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ahoy reader, this is kinda an open letter. But mostly is my desperation in computer font. Rust why don’t you love me? I read about you, I spent nights and days. I fought the borrow checker monster for you. I learned about lifetimes. And you promised two things: - “Systems” language, close to C - Memory safety&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just wanna call you via a C binary. I don’t want you to fly. I just wanna love you…&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
