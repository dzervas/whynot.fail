She was ugly but I was 10 and she was a female that stood near me for an hour and talked to me in a soothing voice. That’s what Rust is, ugly but it’s there for you with a soothing voice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other side we have C++ that the Arduino Framework is written on. Classes here and there, mixed with C, requiring a 3 day workshop to understand what’s the “standard” way of blinking a LED - hence the headache of each Arduino library taking the matters on their own hands. I hate reading C++ by the way and don’t know how to write it. That’s why I want to just forget about it and just call it from Rust.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adding more magic to the Magicforce 68</title><link>https://whynot.fail/hardware/magicforce-68-reversing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whynot.fail/hardware/magicforce-68-reversing/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is a small journey on how I reverse engineered the &lt;a href="https://drop.com/buy/magicforce-68-key-mini-mechanical-keyboard">MagicForce 68&lt;/a> keyboard and tried to add bluetooth functionality to it. It’s a small keyboard (68 keys, 65%) and is USB-only (it’s not the smart model). It has a controller that I can’t flash with a custom firmware, so I had to hook wires on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-hardware">The Hardware&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The first step in determining what I was against, was to at least partially disassemble the keyboard.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
