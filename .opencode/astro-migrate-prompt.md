this is my blog, written in markdown, hugo and a bad notion -> markdown script. The task is to migrate it to astrojs with a custom API fetcher for the actual posts (ignore this part, write a lorem ipsum)

I don't like my current theme (it's brown).

The blog is deeply technical and I try to be funny - it's not professional, it's my hobby and I want it to express me.

I want it to have a dark theme and the frontpage with horizontal that i already have is nice. The content though needs work. the font is a tad small, and the title a bit bigger than I'd like

the domain is https://whynot.fail and you can use browsermcp to visit it and check it out.

I want the new blog to have a clear dark theme, avoiding brown and also some personal touches like the "cut"/dashed vertical lines in https://kottke.org/26/01/0048162-i-feel-stuck-and-sad, or maybe some very subtle ascii art in the background.

I need every post to have tags that are clickable to discover other posts with the same tag
I need every post to have a CI build badge with the states passing/failing/unknown - it's an ongoing joke as to if the project was successful

the resulting, built site must not have js unless it's required and agreed upon. Use build-time js in astro freely

the site must be fully responsive, espcially for mobile devices

The code structure must be kept very clear and concise, use modules to split code where it makes sense and avoid code duplication. use descriptive names and comment weird code that is not apparent what or how it does something.

use the lucide icon library

code block highlighting and callouts (note/info/warning/danger) are of paramout importance

for validation, use the browsermcp to check that the website is correct and consistent across the pages.

you are to generate 3 distinct designs in 3 new folders and for me to choose 1 to continue development all - they should be just a PoC for the color scheme, styling, etc.
