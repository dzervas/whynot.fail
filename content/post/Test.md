Hello World!

# Wow

Why is it that hard to 3D print across years? Why can’t I have consistent printing experience, while not spending a kidney? I don’t get it. Why is the machine constantly failing? I’m a computer guy, I know that human errors are all over the place but how does a machine break on its own so frequently. And don’t get me wrong, it might be a budget Creality Ender 3 but it’s proven to be a good machine and its components are not majestic. This is me… sad…

It’s not often that I’m deeply sad about technology. Most times I’m angry and I do dirty or too opinionated jokes about the subject and I’m feeling better. But at this point, I’m just sad. Today my printer broke again and I have to spent half its cost to fix it. I just want it to do what it was supposed to do, not something else, not hack it, not do it super fast or majestically. I just want to print plastic stuff for fun.
